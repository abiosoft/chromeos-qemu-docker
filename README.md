# Termux + QEMU + Alpine Linux = Docker on ChromeOS w/o Developer Mode
## No Developer Mode Needed.
#### Tutorial for running Docker with an Alpine Linux Host inside of QEMU VM on a ChromeOS/Termux host.

**Warning: Tested on Samsung Chromebook Pro (Intel m3 x86_64 w/ ChromeOS 63, 64) other hardware results may vary.**
*I would be interested to know about other ChromeOS devices, so please let me know your results via PR or email*

What you will need:
1. A ChromeOS Device with Android Apps support. (Again, Developer Mode is **NOT** needed)
2. Install the [**Termux App**](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) [Play Store Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en)
3. Add the [**Termux X/GUI Repos**](https://github.com/xeffyr/termux-x-repository)
4. Download the latest [Alpine **Virutal** ISO (x86_64)](https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/)
